# Code-Quiz

## Description

This is a small quiz made to quickly test your knowledge on a few questions relating to css, HTML, and javascript.

I made this quiz as a test of my skill writing code and as a way to test various components within.

Doing this project taught me a lot about arrays, timer functions, and dynamically inputting elements into the page.
