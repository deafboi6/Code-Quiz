# Code-Quiz

## Description

This is a small quiz made to quickly test your knowledge on a few questions relating to css, HTML, and javascript.

I made this quiz as a test of my skill writing code and as a way to test various components within.

Doing this project taught me a lot about arrays, timer functions, and dynamically inputting elements into the page.

## Usage

Good for a quick little knowledge test.

## Credits

 John Young, my bootcamp instructor.

 I was unable to access a tutor this week, so was to fend for myself entirely, so myself!
